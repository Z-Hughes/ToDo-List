Not your typical ToDoList Application (Dynamically created user specified list. In order to create a new list simply add /nameOfList to the end of the home url).

ToDo list created with Embedded JavaScript templating (EJS). I wanted to do a typically simple project in a non-simple way. New list are created dynamically by adding the name of the list to the end of the url. The list data is maintained using MongoDB via Mongoose. Any changes to the list will only affect the list you are currently using. The focus on this project was communication between the webpage and the server, passing data and functions effectively between files, and data management using a NoSQL database.
